# About Me

I am a Junior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. I am an aspiring software engineer with a keen interest in mobile/web application development and cloud-computing software solutions. At WPI I am also a member of the Varsity Football Team that competes in NCAA Division III. I am a New England native who enjoys activities such as basketball, hiking, and snowboarding. Aside from software and athletics, I am a passionate photographer and videography. Traveling to unique locations where I can capture lifestyle, wildlife, and natural landscape photography is my favorite!
