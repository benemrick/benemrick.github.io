# Design Manifesto

### Introduction
People interact with a variety a natural and humanly constructed entities every day. Underlying each component of society is a series of design considerations that culminate into the final product. From repeated interaction with the surrounding world, humans inherently develop a sense of effective design. Thus, people gravitate towards interactions that satisfy their perception of a proper product, service, building or system. With the increasing role of technology in modern culture, people expect the devices they frequently use to also fulfill their design and functionality desires. Whether individuals are consciously aware of these preferences or not, it is the duty of manufacturers to accurately predict how the general end-user interfaces with technology. Thus, it is imperative that designers engage in a well-defined development procedure. A calculated design philosophy adheres to a set of principles that produce successful designs across various technological mediums. Essential elements of this process include ideation, collaboration, prototyping, aesthetic appeal and assessing performance through user testing. 

### Defining a Venture

The ideation phase of the design process is a crucial preliminary step in discovering a direction. This stage contains both individual and team-oriented endeavors. Through several design modules during the course, it was evident that identifying a problem is necessary for defining a venture. However, this is a difficult task because it requires the irregular perception of common actions. If a problem related to a subject is not immediately visible, then the design team must initiate research. It is pivotal to understand existing solutions and identifying shortcomings. Our group engaged in this process while completing the Design for Wellbeing sprint. Our group struggled to recognize how emotionally aware technology could address deficiencies in wellness applications. Therefore, we individually researched the capabilities and functionality of health-related software. Then, we synthesized our independent ideas for later presentation to the group. Self-directed study allows for each designer to freely examine ideas without influence or bias imparted by other members. Next, with a collection of unique approaches, we analyzed the results in the context of the given end goal and listed viable options. We listed potential avenues on a brainstorming sheet as depicted in Figure 1. Our results included a rating system for sensing humor levels, detecting stress during homework, and predicting meal choices. The solidified list served as a point of reference for discussion and allowed us the select the meal generator as our intended pursuit. The conception of a brainstorming sheet or physical display of all potential ideas is critical for future refinement. Also, the Kixlab document on idea generation mentions the importance of aiming for a high quantity of ideas at this stage. Figure 2 represents a portion of our idea list generated during the brainstorming component of the Design for Tension module. This list, derived from researching the subject matter and creative exploration, should then be filtered to best align with the project’s functional requirements. 

### Sketching

After creating a collection of different pursuits, the group must consolidate the list. It is best to perform this phase in a team setting with all members present. This procedure requires manifesting abstract thoughts into conceptual displays. For many tasks, this is completed through rudimentary sketches, flow diagrams, charts, advanced descriptions or any other elaborative method of communication. Utilization of a shared whiteboard or sticky notes is excellent for facilitating evaluation. A physical illustration of each idea will allow the group to further envision the concept and thus distinguish the merit of each design. Once enough ideas are eliminated, the remaining solutions should undergo a more rigorous analytic process in order to select a single pursuit. Through the design experiences in this course, I learned that creating the intermediary design-sheets as outlined in the Five Design Sheet methodology is the most successful. In the Design for Wellbeing module, we experimented with different styles of final contestants. Figure 3 depicts two of the initial designs that resulted from our brainstorming session. This technique is beneficial because it mandates the designer to consider the idea beyond a simple sketch and layout. The designer must inquire further and detail the specific focuses and design motives while explaining the advantages and disadvantages. Often, this step is overlooked because teams are unwilling to confront the negative implications of design and become blind to apparent flaws. This approach stimulates critical review early in the process, which contributes to a more effective initial design before the prototyping phase.

### Prototyping
The next essential phase of the design process is prototyping. Similar to the effect of sketching an idea, prototyping allows abstractions to become physical illustrations. A prototype should act as an intermediary between defining the venture and the final design. Testing the prototype will give clarity as to the merit of the design and will inform the designers if they need to cycle back in the process. This is a critical point of judgment that will often uncover necessary areas of improvement. If a complete overhaul of the intended design is appropriate, then the alternate ideas recorded in the five-design sheets are a strong reference.

                  *Alternate mark styles*

Due to time constraints in this course, we focused most of our efforts on low-fidelity prototypes. In the first sprint, Design for Others, we created a paper prototype to test a specific element of the overall design. Throughout the course, it proved much more effective to isolate a single feature for testing rather than assess the entire application. It is increasingly beneficial to isolate elements with high granularity such as depicting possible fonts, colors or layout organizations. The purpose of the prototyping process is to receive meaningful feedback that can be translated into an improved design. Therefore, by creating multiple versions of the same feature, page, or screen the user can definitely select a preference. This technique is far more accurate than instructing a user to peruse an entire application and generally notify areas of weakness. From creating a prototype that isolates key design elements in question, the designers can better understand user perception of that specific detail while maintaining feedback of the entire product. This strategy was beneficial during the Design for Understand sprint where we created a data visualization. During the prototyping round of testing, we sought to reveal the most visually pleasing and accurate style of mark on a scatterplot. To test this we created two graphs of the exact same data. One graph contained marks that were color-coded by category and the other included marks of similar color but varied in size. Users tended to prefer the code-coded marks over the size varying points. This information was directly incorporated into our final design. 

### Aesthetic
Overlaying the design process are several key design principles that increase the aesthetic appeal of a system. This, in turn, promotes the functionality of the design and contributes to user satisfaction. When employing content on a visual medium, designers should adhere to minimalist styles. This prohibits the inclusion of elements that do not aid in communicating the overall purpose of the system. Arbitrary colors, text, images or textures should always be removed in order to promote a clear design. Typically, aesthetically appealing designs feature a single text font and incorporate a unifying color scheme. Colors combinations should be selected mindfully and coincide with the tone or mood of the design. Furthermore, the colors must accent the content and be used across various screens or pages to establish a sense of unity. A cluttered appearance often overwhelms the user and makes regular action or navigation of the design increasingly difficult. However, the designer must be conscious enough to impart a healthy balance of information. There is a weakness is purposefully omitting content that aids the user’s experience. Attempting to achieve hyper-minimalism can result in a lack of clarity and cause confusion. 

This was apparent through the Design for Wellbeing activity. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3CerGFKxnU) above recaps our final design for an emotionally aware meal generator application. We iterated through several designs prior to reaching the final product. Each iteration consisted of eliminating aspects that we felt did not contribute to the overall theme of the application. Through extensive user testing, we observed subtly uncertainties throughout the user experience. Users typically performed the correct actions in the proper sequence yet were unsure of the purpose and seemed confused about the underlying mechanics of the website. In our reflection, we stated that the shortcomings of the final design were a result of over-simplifying the design to the point where it failed to communicate the basic goal. Since this is an irregular concept, perhaps more textual description or animated prompts on the screen would better deliver the message of the system.

### User Testing
User testing is a valuable aspect of the entire design process. This process helps to gauge user experience and understand if the software properly bridges the gap between technology and human desires. Properly structuring the testing environment is critical in optimizing the results. It is important for the administrator to give a brief overview of the software without revealing any influential information. If the facilitator has chosen to test a specific feature, then it is appropriate to instruct the user to complete a task. Otherwise, the user should not be deliberately instructed to perform any set of actions. Rather, they must be uncoerced and free to navigate and interact with the software as they naturally would. Another essential role in this process is the observer. In all of the user tests throughout the term, we utilized an observer. The observer should not interact with the user at all. Instead, they are responsible for merely recording their actions and making any notes of alarming tendencies or behaviors. If no observer is present then it is equally as beneficial to video record the session. Ultimately, it is imperative that a record of the user’s specific behaviors exist. A detailed understanding of the sequence of movements, keystrokes or interactions performed by the user offers tremendous insight into the usability of the application. To facilitate this understanding the administrator of the test should instruct the user to think aloud throughout the experience. This requires the user to audible announce why they are performing such actions and the thought process underlying each decision. This streamlines the efforts of the observer and reduces the possibility of misinterpretation. Also, often times the user behaves unknowingly and fails to communicate subtle details when voicing their opinion. Lastly, the user can provide overall feedback about the experience once they have completed using the application or have finished a task. They should be encouraged to suggest changes and state positive and negative aspects of the interaction. [This video](https://youtu.be/DNurOfk4kIs) above depicts a user recapping their experience while an observer takes notes during the Design for Another World demonstration.


### Conclusion
These core principles of the design process culminate into a cohesive recipe for delivering a successful product. Underlying the entirety of the procedure is collaboration. This is an ongoing workflow that leverages the skills of numerous people. Teams often include various personalities and perspectives which is beneficial in challenging and refining designs. However, these differences need to be harnessed for positive action in order to optimize success. In embarking on a new venture, designers may adhere to a set of guidelines to find a sense of direction. However, a design philosophy should never restrict the possibilities of technology. It is reasonable to tailor particular aspects of the design procedure to the nuances of a project. While best practices exist, designers should always be encouraged to create freely and test the conventions of design.
