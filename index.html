From repeated interaction with the surrounding world, humans inherently develop a sense of effective design. Thus, people gravitate towards interactions that satisfy their perception of a proper product, service, building or system. With the increasing role of technology in modern culture, people expect the devices they frequently use to also fulfill their design and functionality desires. Whether individuals are consciously aware of these preferences or not, it is the duty of manufacturers to accurately predict how the general end-user interfaces with technology. Thus, it is imperative that designers engage in a well-defined development procedure. A calculated design philosophy adheres to a set of principles that produce successful designs across various technological mediums. Essential elements of this process include ideation, collaboration, prototyping, aesthetic appeal and assessing performance through user testing.
